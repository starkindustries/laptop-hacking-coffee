# Lost Passwords

## Forensics & OSINT: 100 Points

## Challenge
My boss Susan and our other admin Larry just called and said they forgot the shared Twitter password for our company. She said she stored it in a spreadsheet somewhere. Theyâ€™re both a bunch of dorks for forgetting it. Either way, maybe you can help me find it anyway?
