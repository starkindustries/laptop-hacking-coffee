> Want the flag? Call me! It's the entire first sentence.  
No spaces, no punctuation.

Attempts:
* Sent Holtz a tweet
* Sent Holtz an email to albertholtzmaniii@protonmail.com
* Sent Holtz a message on Discord @AlHoltz1337

Flag is **not**:
* LHC{wanttheflag} (first sentence of "flag" tweet)
* LHC{Justregisteredmyfirstdomain} (very first tweet)
* LHC{wannabel33tlikeme} (first sentence in Discord spam post)
* the lyrics to Call Me! (Blondie 1980)
