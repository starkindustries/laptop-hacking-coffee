# Dox

## Points: 150

## Challenge
Some dude keeps spamming our Discord. Can you dox him for us?

This is the message he keeps posting:

![img][1]

(Be sure to use the LHC{flag} syntax!)

[LEET.jpg][1]

## Solution
Google **AlbertHoltzmanIII**. Find his twitter:

https://twitter.com/AHoltzTheThird

Browse his tweets:

> Want the flag? Call me! It's the entire first sentence.  
No spaces, no punctuation.

He says "Call me" but does not provide his phone number. Maybe his website might have it. But the website is down:

> Had to take my website down. Kept getting spam calls. I'll rebuild it and put it back online later. Anyone know how to do #WordPress?

Find a way to view his website. Search [wayback machine][2] for his website **hackingis1337.club**:

Find his number:
```

PO Box 1337

```

Call the number. The song **Never Gonna Give You Up** by Rick Astley plays over the phone call. Refer back to the tweet:

> Call me! It's the entire first sentence.  
No spaces, no punctuation.

The entire first sentence of the song is:
```
We're no strangers to love
```

Put this in flag format without spaces and without punctuation:
```
LHC{werenostrangerstolove}
```
