## Challenge

My mortal enemy has hidden his password in a random string. I have the original file and the file with his password, can you find it for me?

Note: Be sure to encase it in LHC{}

[key.txt](key.txt) 

[secret.txt](secret.txt)

## Solution
Open up [text-compare](https://text-compare.com/), paste the key into the left side and paste the secret into the right side. Write down the extra characters:
```
d1fFeRenT!
```

Format as flag:
```
LHC{d1fFeRenT!}
