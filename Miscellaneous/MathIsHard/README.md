# Math is Hard

## Miscellaneous: 75 Points

## Challenge

30.0826618 - 97.1443869

## Solution
The key is to realize that this is a geo location:
```
30.0826618, -97.1443869
```

Google these coordinates and look at the satellite image:

![maps][1]

The coordinate points to Luecke Farm in Smithville, Texas.

> A Texas landowner spelled out his name with three miles of trees, a giant signature that's been used by NASA to evaluate satellite imagery -- [Atlas Obscura][3]

![luecke][2]

Format as flag and submit:
```
LHC{LUECKE}
```
