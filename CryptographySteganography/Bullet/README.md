# Bullet

## Points: 25

## Challenge
I won a bullet at the recent cybercowboy conference and it had this etched into it '9c0a81866acce1bde0ef5520a2155054' on it... can you tell me what it means?

Note: Be sure to encase the flag in LHC{}

## Solution
Take a look at the string. Notice that it is made of hexadecimal characters.

`9c0a81866acce1bde0ef5520a2155054`

Count the number of characters in the string. Open up CyberChef, paste the string into input, and look at the `length`. 

https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef

The length is 32 hexadecimal characters, which is equal to 16 bytes (128 bits). This looks very similar to a hash. To confirm this, pull the **Analyze Hash** function into the recipe zone. This gives us this output:

```
Hash length: 32
Byte length: 16
Bit length:  128

Based on the length, this hash could have been generated by one of the following hashing functions:
MD5
MD4
MD2
HAVAL-128
RIPEMD-128
Snefru
Tiger-128
```

One of the hash functions listed is MD5. Maybe the goal is to reverse this hash. A quick google search of the hash gives this result:

This link reveals the reversed string:
```
The MD5 hash:
9c0a81866acce1bde0ef5520a2155054
was succesfully reversed into the string:

```

Format as flag:
```
LHC{waytooeasy}
```
