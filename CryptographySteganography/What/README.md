## Fun Fact
There are two channels in the wav file. One contains the hidden message. The other contains dramatic music and a whisper "I know this". This sound byte is from Jurassic Park during the [velociraptor scene][1]. The girl runs up to the computer and whispers, "It's a Unix system. I know this."
